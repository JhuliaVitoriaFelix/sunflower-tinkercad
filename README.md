# 🌻 Sunflower Light Tracker – Arduino Uno R3 (Tinkercad)

This project simulates a **sunflower that reacts to light** using an Arduino Uno R3 on Tinkercad.
It demonstrates how photoresistors (LDRs) and a servo motor can be combined to mimic natural heliotropism.

## 🔧 Features

* Arduino Uno R3 implementation
* Dual LDR light sensors for detection
* Servo motor control for sunflower movement
* Fully simulated in Tinkercad

## 🚀 How It Works

1. Two LDR sensors measure light intensity from left and right.
2. The Arduino compares sensor values.
3. The servo rotates towards the side with stronger light.
